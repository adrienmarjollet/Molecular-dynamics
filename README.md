# Molecular dynamics library

(In progress) Files containing functions related their own molecular dynamics (MD) subfield or specific utilities.

## Description of the .py files:

1) PIGLET.py : Path-integral Generalized Langevin Thermostat approximations to quantum fluctuations. The 1D case is treated here, contact me if you wish to
see the code for the general case.

2) RPMDNMA.py : Tools for vibrational mode analysis in the standard cartesian coordinate system and in the ring polymer normal mode coordinate representation.

3) RPMDPROPA.py : Adaptation of several iterative methods using temporal discretization to propagate the ring polymer phase space.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Prerequisite libraries: Python with NumPy.

### Executing program

Simply import as module the files and use it directly in your molecular dynamics simulations.
